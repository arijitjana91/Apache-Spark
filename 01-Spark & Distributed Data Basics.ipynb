    "**What is HDFS ?**<br>\n",
    "> Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is a highly fault-tolerant, open-source distributed storage system designed to manage massive datasets (petabytes) across clusters of low-cost, commodity hardware.<p>It uses a master/slave architecture—consisting of a NameNode (metadata) and DataNodes (block storage)—to provide high throughput, data replication, and high availability.<p>\n",
    "**Note: HDFS is the foundational storage layer for the Apache Hadoop ecosystem, widely used for Big Data analytics, AI, and machine learning workloads.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Aspects of HDFS\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture\n",
    "![image-7.png](attachment:image-7.png)\n",
    "- HDFS divides large files into smaller blocks (default 128 MB)  \n",
    "- Replicates blocks across multiple nodes to prevent data loss (default: 3 replicas, each at different Data Node.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### HDFS Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "In HDFS, a **block** is the smallest unit of data that the file system can store or process.  \n",
    "Instead of storing a massive 10 GB file as one giant piece, HDFS chops it into smaller, uniform chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Blocks?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parallel Processing:**  \n",
    "  Since a file is split into many blocks, different servers (DataNodes) can process different parts of the same file simultaneously, drastically speeding up big data tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fault Tolerance:**  \n",
    "  Each block is copied (replicated) to multiple servers (usually 3). If one server crashes, the system retrieves a copy of the block from another server.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability:**  \n",
    "  A single file can be larger than any individual hard drive in the cluster because its blocks can be distributed across hundreds of different disk\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components\n",
    "- **NameNode:**  \n",
    "  The master node that manages the file system namespace, maintains the file system tree, and tracks metadata for files.  \n",
    "\n",
    "  ## **NameNode Function FsImage, EditLog and Other HDFS Metadata Files (Explained Simply)**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ---\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### FsImage\n",
    "\n",
    "  FsImage is a snapshot of the HDFS file system metadata at a point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "  It contains:\n",
    "  - Directory structure  \n",
    "  - File names  \n",
    "  - Permissions  \n",
    "  - Block mappings (file → block IDs)  \n",
    "\n",
    "  📌 **FsImage does NOT store actual data — only metadata.**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Think of it as:  \n",
    "  > A photograph of the HDFS namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ---\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### EditLog\n",
    "\n",
    "  EditLog records every change made to HDFS after the FsImage was created.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Examples:\n",
    "  - Create file  \n",
    "  - Delete file  \n",
    "  - Rename file  \n",
    "  - Change permissions  \n",
    "\n",
    "  Why it exists:\n",
    "  - Writing to FsImage every time would be slow  \n",
    "  - EditLog lets NameNode log changes efficiently  \n",
    "\n",
    "  Think of it as:  \n",
    "  > A transaction log.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ---\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### How FsImage + EditLog Work Together\n",
    "\n",
    "  - NameNode loads FsImage  \n",
    "  - Replays EditLog on top of it  \n",
    "  - Reconstructs the latest HDFS state in memory  \n",
    "\n",
    "  Without EditLog → **data loss**  \n",
    "  Without FsImage → **slow startup**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ---\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### Secondary NameNode (Important!)\n",
    "\n",
    "  Despite the name, it is **NOT** a backup NameNode.\n",
    "\n",
    "  What it does:\n",
    "  - Periodically fetches FsImage and EditLog  \n",
    "  - Merges them into a new FsImage  \n",
    "  - Sends the compacted FsImage back  \n",
    "\n",
    "  Purpose:\n",
    "  - Prevents EditLog from growing too large  \n",
    "  - Reduces NameNode restart time  \n",
    "\n",
    "  ---\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### Checkpoint Node / Standby NameNode\n",
    "\n",
    "  In modern Hadoop:\n",
    "  - Checkpoint Node or Standby NameNode replaces Secondary NameNode  \n",
    "  - Provides high availability  \n",
    "  - Keeps metadata in sync using ZooKeeper  \n",
    "\n",
    "  ---\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### Interview-Ready Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **FsImage:** Snapshot of HDFS metadata  \n",
    "  - **EditLog:** Record of metadata changes  \n",
    "  - **Secondary NameNode:** Merges FsImage and EditLog  \n",
    "  - **Standby NameNode:** High availability and failover  \n",
    "\n",
    "  ---\n",
    "  ### Heartbeats and Block Reports in HDFS\n",
    "\n",
    "  The NameNode regularly receives **heartbeats** and **block reports** from all DataNodes to ensure they are alive and to maintain accurate metadata about block locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ---\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### Heartbeat\n",
    "  - Sent frequently (every ~3 seconds by default)  \n",
    "  - Tells the NameNode:  \n",
    "    > “I am alive and functioning”  \n",
    "  - If heartbeats stop for a threshold time, the DataNode is marked **dead**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ---\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### Block Report\n",
    "  - Sent less frequently (about once per hour by default)  \n",
    "  - Contains:  \n",
    "    - List of all blocks stored on that DataNode  \n",
    "  - Used by the NameNode to:  \n",
    "    - Track block locations  \n",
    "    - Detect under-replicated or over-replicated blocks  \n",
    "  ---\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DataNodes:**  \n",
    "  Slave nodes that store actual data blocks and perform block creation, deletion, and replication upon instructions from the NameNode.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ## **DataNode Functions and HDFS Read/Write Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### Main Functions of DataNode\n",
    "  - **Store Blocks:** Stores actual data blocks on local disks.  \n",
    "  - **Serve Client Requests:** Reads and writes blocks for clients.  \n",
    "  - **Heartbeat:** Sends regular heartbeats to the NameNode to indicate it is alive.  \n",
    "  - **Block Report:** Periodically sends a list of all stored blocks to the NameNode.  \n",
    "  - **Block Replication:** Replicates blocks to other DataNodes when instructed by the NameNode.  \n",
    "  - **Block Deletion:** Deletes blocks when files are removed or over-replicated.  \n",
    "  - **Data Integrity:** Maintains checksums for blocks to detect corruption.  \n",
    "\n",
    "  ### **HDFS Write Process (Client → HDFS)**\n",
    "  1. Client contacts the **NameNode** for block allocation.  \n",
    "  2. NameNode returns a list of **DataNodes** where each block will be stored (default 3 replicas).  \n",
    "  3. Client splits the file into blocks and sends each block to the **first DataNode**.  \n",
    "  4. The first DataNode writes the block and pipelines it to the **second DataNode**, which then pipelines to the **third DataNode**.  \n",
    "  5. Each DataNode sends an **acknowledgement** back along the pipeline to the client.  \n",
    "  6. Once all blocks are written and acknowledged, the write is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Write Pipeline Diagram:**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![image-8.png](attachment:image-8.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Client asks NameNode for block locations.\n",
    "  - NameNode chooses three DataNodes (DN1, DN2, DN3).\n",
    "  - Client sends block to DN1 → pipelined to DN2 → pipelined to DN3.\n",
    "  - Each DataNode sends acknowledgment back to client.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ---\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### **HDFS Read Process (Client ← HDFS)**\n",
    "  1. Client contacts **NameNode** to get the block locations for the file.  \n",
    "  2. NameNode returns the list of DataNodes storing each block.  \n",
    "  3. Client reads blocks **directly from the nearest DataNode** to optimize network usage.  \n",
    "  4. If a DataNode is down, the client automatically reads the block from the next replica.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Read diagram (text-based):**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![image-9.png](attachment:image-9.png)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Client asks NameNode where the blocks are.\n",
    "  - NameNode returns DataNode locations.\n",
    "  - Client reads blocks from the closest or fastest replica.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "- **Fault Tolerance:** Automatic recovery from node failures through data replication  \n",
    "- **High Throughput:** Designed for streaming data access rather than low-latency random access  \n",
    "- **Scalability:** Can be scaled to thousands of nodes, holding petabytes of data  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Commands\n",
    "- Similar to Linux commands, using `hdfs dfs` or `hadoop fs` for file management (e.g., `ls`, `put`, `get`)\n",
